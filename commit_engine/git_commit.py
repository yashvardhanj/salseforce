Successful Changes ‚Äì Briefly list the modifications that were implemented correctly and function as intended.

Unsuccessful Changes ‚Äì Briefly list the changes that were attempted but are either broken, incomplete, or do not function as intended.

Ensure the summary is direct, avoids unnecessary elaboration, and focuses strictly on observable functionality and outcomes.
